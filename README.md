This is a firmware that runs on the Arbotix Robocontroller, supported arms found here:

It has several library dependencies, found in our Arbotix fork here: https://github.com/trossenrobotics/arbotix

This firmware is used to control the arm via serial packet, which breaks out absolute X, Y, Z Axis control, Wrist angle, Wrist rotation, Gripper control, as well as speed control. In addition, it also has the ability to control digital outputs on the arbotix, read analog inputs, and switch between several control/IK modes. More information to come.
